I'm a Ph.D. candidate in applied mathematics at the University of Washington advised by <a href='https://heatherw3521.github.io/'>Heather Wilber</a> and <a href='https://faculty.washington.edu/trogdon/'>Tom Trogdon</a>. My research interests involve numerical methods for partial differential equations (PDEs), with an emphasis on spectral methods, complex analysis, and fast algorithms. My projects involve numericaly using the unified transform method of Fokas to approximate non-linear PDEs as well as solving the wave equation in trapping domains.
